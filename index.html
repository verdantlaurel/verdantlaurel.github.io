        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
        <p>I am continually seeking new experiences and knowledge, looking for opportunities to better understand and improve the relationships we have with each other and the world we share.</p>
        <p>Efficiency and organization are just two things I am passionate about, and when I find an opportunity for either, I feel driven to take action!</p>
        <p>I believe even the smallest details can make a big difference, and I take pride in applying my skills to thorough research, planning, and creation of innovative design concepts.</p>
        <p>My open-minded and outgoing personality makes me approachable and lets my peers know that I want to contribute.</p>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I enjoy cooking and baking regularly, using local, natural or organic ingredients.
          <br>Occassionally, I'll end up with too many treats and have to bring them to work or class for others to sample.</p>
        <p>Other activities include yoga, as well as bicycling, hiking, and more when it's <em>not</em> Winter around here.</p>
